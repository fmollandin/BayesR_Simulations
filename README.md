# BayesR_Simulations

The repository is divided into three parts: \\
-Fortran source code of the software used to simulate data based on real genotypes. An example of parameters and description of their use are also provided.\\
-The modified version of BayesR (available at \url{https://github.com/syntheke/bayesR}), including recovery of the estimated per-SNP effects for each iteration, which in turn facilitates the estimation of per-SNP posterior variances. An example of the use of this software is also provided. 
-Partial R scripts used to analyze the BayesR model output and visualize the corresponding results. Scripts to reproduce all figures presented in the article are also included.
